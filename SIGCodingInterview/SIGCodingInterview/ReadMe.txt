Coding challenge I did on SIG's on-site interviews. 
I kinda botched the interview, even though I got a very optimized solution, I was too stressed in creating clean and maintainable code.
I was mainly struggling with not knowing that STL maps had an lower and upper bound method and wasn't using a binary tree to its full advantage. Instead I choose to use a binary search on an array which was a lot hard to do during an interview.
I went back and attempted it a second time after with an entirely different approach I had during the interview after thinking about a better implementation.
This challenge tests your use of data structures, libraries, algothrims and most importantly your object oriented approach.
Great question to practice for interviews.
